        December 24th 2022 Robin started his first real software project, a web
        application about fastfood where he would post pictures and reviews of
        fastfood so people have an easier time deciding what to eat(and not
        getting scammed buying something that wasn't what they thought it would
        be)
        <br />
        In the end of 2023 the web application went online, a maxed out website
        using all the neccesary features for creating a next level food
        community.It had everything from creating users to admin accounts and
        password resets truly built different
        <br />
        Within the first 24 hours the web application already had 3+ registered
        users, the number is growing to this day and investors don't see it
        stopping anytime soon.
